Project Description
This project aims to analyze student performance based on various factors such as education boards (SEBA, CBSE, OTHER), coaching (NO, WA, OA), and parental occupation. The goal is to discover trends and insights that could influence student success and improve educational strategies.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
Gender: Student's gender (Male, Female)
Caste: Student's caste category (General, SC, ST, OBC, etc.)
Coaching: Type of coaching received (NO - No coaching, WA - With Assistance, OA - Other Assistance)
Class_ten_education: Education board for Class X (SEBA, CBSE, OTHER)
Class_X_Percentage: Percentage obtained in Class X
Class_XII_Percentage: Percentage obtained in Class XII
Father_occupation: Occupation of the student's father
Mother_occupation: Occupation of the student's mother
Time: Study time or duration (if applicable)
Performance: General performance indicator (if available)
Data Cleaning & Transformation
The following steps were performed to clean and prepare the data:
Renamed columns for better readability.
Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., twelve_education).
Standardized Coaching values to ensure consistency.
Verified and corrected data types.
Removed duplicate entries (if any).
Visualizations & Reports
